# Structopt

This is the argument parser I use in my engine and various supporting tools. It's a work in progress, I'm adding features to it as I need them.

# WIP array args
- parsefree?
- support --name arg --name arg as well as --name arg arg?
- make sure not to allow as positional args
- test help menu and stuff, look at all existing tests
- support -no-... to clear
